Deployment architecture
In this guide, you use the following Google Cloud products:

Cloud Build to create a CI/CD pipeline for building, deploying, and testing a data-processing workflow, and the data processing itself. Cloud Build is a managed service that runs your build on Google Cloud. A build is a series of build steps where each step is run in a Docker container.
Cloud Composer to define and run the steps of the workflow, such as starting the data processing, testing and verifying results. Cloud Composer is a managed Apache Airflow service, which offers an environment where you can create, schedule, monitor, and manage complex workflows, such as the data-processing workflow in this tutorial.
Dataflow to run the Apache Beam WordCount example as a sample data process.
The CI/CD pipeline
At a high level, the CI/CD pipeline consists of the following steps:

Cloud Build packages the WordCount sample into a self-running Java Archive (JAR) file using the Maven builder. The Maven builder is a container with Maven installed in it. When a build step is configured to use the Maven builder, Maven runs the tasks.
Cloud Build uploads the JAR file to Cloud Storage.
Cloud Build runs unit tests on the data-processing workflow code and deploys the workflow code to Cloud Composer.
Cloud Composer picks up the JAR file and runs the data-processing job on Dataflow.
The following diagram shows a detailed view of the CI/CD pipeline steps.

The deployments to the test and production environments are separated into two different Cloud Build pipelinesâ€“a test and a production pipeline.

In the preceding diagram, the test pipeline consists of the following steps:

A developer commits code changes to the Cloud Source Repositories.
Code changes trigger a test build in Cloud Build.
Cloud Build builds the self-executing JAR file and deploys it to the test JAR bucket on Cloud Storage.
Cloud Build deploys the test files to the test-file buckets on Cloud Storage.
Cloud Build sets the variable in Cloud Composer to reference the newly deployed JAR file.
Cloud Build tests the data-processing workflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and deploys it to the Cloud Composer bucket on Cloud Storage.
The workflow DAG file is deployed to Cloud Composer.
Cloud Build triggers the newly deployed data-processing workflow to run.
In the preceding diagram, the production pipeline consists of the following steps:

A developer manually runs the production deployment pipeline in Cloud Build.
Cloud Build copies the latest self-executing JAR file from the test JAR bucket to the production JAR bucket on Cloud Storage.
Cloud Build tests the production data-processing workflow DAG and deploys it to the Cloud Composer bucket on Cloud Storage.
The production workflow DAG file is deployed to Cloud Composer.

the production data-processing workflow is deployed to the same Cloud Composer environment as the test workflow, to give a consolidated view of all data-processing workflows. For the purposes of this tutorial, the environments are separated by using different Cloud Storage buckets to hold the input and output data.

To completely separate the environments, you need multiple Cloud Composer environments created in different projects, which are by default separated from each other. This separation helps to secure your production environment. This approach is outside the scope of this tutorial. For more information about how to access resources across multiple Google Cloud projects, see Setting service account permissions.

The data-processing workflow
The instructions for how Cloud Composer runs the data-processing workflow are defined in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) written in Python. In the DAG, all the steps of the data-processing workflow are defined together with the dependencies between them.

The CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys the DAG definition from Cloud Source Repositories to Cloud Composer in each build. This process ensures that Cloud Composer is always up to date with the latest workflow definition without needing any human intervention.

In the DAG definition for the test environment, an end-to-end test step is defined in addition to the data-processing workflow. The test step helps make sure that the data-processing workflow runs correctly.

The data-processing workflow is illustrated in the following diagram.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4884923/126560223-0383da4e-2c76-41c5-ab71-9f0f00ab4af2.png)


The data-processing workflow consists of the following steps:

Run the WordCount data process in Dataflow.
Download the output files from the WordCount process. The WordCount process outputs three files:

download_result_1
download_result_2
download_result_3
Download the reference file, called download_ref_string.

Verify the result against the reference file. This integration test aggregates all three results and compares the aggregated results with the reference file.

Using a task-orchestration framework such as Cloud Composer to manage the data-processing workflow helps alleviate the code complexity of the workflow.




The tests
In addition to the integration test that verifies the data-processing workflow from end to end, there are two unit tests in this tutorial. The unit tests are automatic tests on the data-processing code and the data-processing workflow code. The test on the data-processing code is written in Java and runs automatically during the Maven build process. The test on the data-processing workflow code is written in Python and runs as an independent build step.

Objectives
Configure the Cloud Composer environment.
Create Cloud Storage buckets for your data.
Create the build, test, and production pipelines.
Configure the build trigger.

Cloud components used :

Cloud Source Repositories
Cloud Build
Cloud Composer
Dataflow
Cloud Storage


In the Cloud Console, open Cloud Shell:

Open Cloud Shell

Clone the sample code repository:


git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow.git
Run a script to set environment variables:


cd ~/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow/env-setup
source set_env.sh
The script sets the following environment variables:

Your Google Cloud project ID
Your region and zone
The name of your Cloud Storage buckets that are used by the build pipeline and the data-processing workflow.
Because environment variables aren't retained between sessions, if your Cloud Shell session shuts down or disconnects while you are working through the tutorial, you need to reset the environment variables.


Creating the Cloud Composer environment
In this tutorial, you set up a Cloud Composer environment that consists of n1-standard-1 nodes.

In Cloud Shell, create the Cloud Composer environment:


gcloud composer environments create $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION \
    --zone $COMPOSER_ZONE_ID \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --node-count 3 \
    --disk-size 20 \
    --python-version 2
Note: It usually takes about 15 minutes to provision the Cloud Composer environment, but it can take up to one hour. Wait until this process is completed before continuing onto the next steps.
Run a script to set the variables in the Cloud Composer environment. The variables are needed for the data-processing DAGs.

Run a script to set the variables in the Cloud Composer environment. The variables are needed for the data-processing DAGs.


cd ~/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow/env-setup
chmod +x set_composer_variables.sh
./set_composer_variables.sh
The script sets the following environment variables:

Your Google Cloud project ID
Your region and zone
The name of your Cloud Storage buckets that are used by the build pipeline and the data-processing workflow.
Extract the Cloud Composer environment properties
Cloud Composer uses a Cloud Storage bucket to store DAGs. Moving a DAG definition file to the bucket triggers Cloud Composer to automatically read the files. You created the Cloud Storage bucket for Cloud Composer when you created the Cloud Composer environment. In the following procedure, you extract the URL for the buckets, and then configure your CI/CD pipeline to automatically deploy DAG definitions to the Cloud Storage bucket.

In Cloud Shell, export the URL for the bucket as an environment variable:


export COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET=$(gcloud composer environments describe $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION \
    --format="get(config.dagGcsPrefix)")
Export the name of the service account that Cloud Composer uses in order to have access to the Cloud Storage buckets:


export COMPOSER_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=$(gcloud composer environments describe $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION \
    --format="get(config.nodeConfig.serviceAccount)")
Creating the Cloud Storage buckets
In this section you create a set of Cloud Storage buckets to store the following:

Artifacts of the intermediate steps of the build process.
The input and output files for the data-processing workflow.
The staging location for the Dataflow jobs to store their binary files.
To create the Cloud Storage buckets, complete the following step:

In Cloud Shell, create Cloud Storage buckets and give the Cloud Composer service account permission to run the data-processing workflows:


cd ~/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow/env-setup
chmod +x create_buckets.sh
./create_buckets.sh
Pushing the source code to Cloud Source Repositories
In this tutorial, you have one source code base that you need to put into version control. The following step shows how a code base is developed and changes over time. Whenever changes are pushed to the repository, the pipeline to build, deploy, and test is triggered.

In Cloud Shell, push the source-code folder to Cloud Source Repositories:


gcloud source repos create $SOURCE_CODE_REPO
cp -r ~/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow/source-code ~/$SOURCE_CODE_REPO
cd ~/$SOURCE_CODE_REPO
git init
git remote add google \
    https://source.developers.google.com/p/$GCP_PROJECT_ID/r/$SOURCE_CODE_REPO
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push google master
These are standard commands to initialize Git in a new directory and push the content to a remote repository.

Creating Cloud Build pipelines
In this section, you create the build pipelines that build, deploy, and test the data-processing workflow.

Grant access to Cloud Build service account
Cloud Build deploys Cloud Composer DAGs and triggers workflows, which are enabled when you add additional access to the Cloud Build service account. For more information about the different roles available when working with Cloud Composer, see the access control documentation.

In Cloud Shell, add the composer.admin role to the Cloud Build service account so the Cloud Build job can set Airflow variables in Cloud Composer:


gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCP_PROJECT_ID \
    --member=serviceAccount:$PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/composer.admin
Add the composer.worker role to the Cloud Build service account so the Cloud Build job can trigger the data workflow in Cloud Composer:


gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $GCP_PROJECT_ID \
    --member=serviceAccount:$PROJECT_NUMBER@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
    --role=roles/composer.worker
Create the build and test pipeline
The build and test pipeline steps are configured in the YAML configuration file. In this tutorial, you use prebuilt builder images for git, maven, gsutil, and gcloud to run the tasks in each build step. You use configuration variable substitutions to define the environment settings at build time. The source code repository location is defined by variable substitutions, as well as the locations of Cloud Storage buckets. The build needs this information to deploy the JAR file, test files, and the DAG definition.

In Cloud Shell, submit the build pipeline configuration file to create the pipeline in Cloud Build:


cd ~/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow/source-code/build-pipeline
gcloud builds submit --config=build_deploy_test.yaml --substitutions=\
REPO_NAME=$SOURCE_CODE_REPO,\
_DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET=$DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_TEST,\
_COMPOSER_INPUT_BUCKET=$INPUT_BUCKET_TEST,\
_COMPOSER_REF_BUCKET=$REF_BUCKET_TEST,\
_COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET=$COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET,\
_COMPOSER_ENV_NAME=$COMPOSER_ENV_NAME,\
_COMPOSER_REGION=$COMPOSER_REGION,\
_COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_TEST=$COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_TEST
This command instructs Cloud Build to run a build with the following steps:

Build and deploy the WordCount self-executing JAR file.

Check out the source code.
Compile the WordCount Beam source code into a self-executing JAR file.
Store the JAR file on Cloud Storage where it can be picked up by Cloud Composer to run the WordCount processing job.
Deploy and set up the data-processing workflow on Cloud Composer.

Run the unit test on the custom-operator code used by the workflow DAG.
Deploy the test input file and the test reference file on Cloud Storage. The test input file is the input for the WordCount processing job. The test reference file is used as a reference to verify the output of the WordCount processing job.
Set the Cloud Composer variables to point to the newly built JAR file.
Deploy the workflow DAG definition to the Cloud Composer environment.
Run the data-processing workflow in the test environment to trigger the test-processing workflow.

Verify the build and test pipeline
After you submit the build file, verify the build steps.

In the Cloud Console, go to the Build History page to view a list of all past and currently running builds.

Go to Build History page

Click the build that is currently running.

On the Build details page, verify that the build steps match the previously described steps.

Details of the build steps.

On the Build details page, the Status field of the build says Build successful when the build finishes.

In Cloud Shell, verify that the WordCount sample JAR file was copied into the correct bucket:


gsutil ls gs://$DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_TEST/dataflow_deployment*.jar
The output is similar to the following:


gs://â€¦-composer-dataflow-source-test/dataflow_deployment_e88be61e-50a6-4aa0-beac-38d75871757e.jar
Get the URL to your Cloud Composer web interface. Make a note of the URL because it's used in the next step.


gcloud composer environments describe $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION \
    --format="get(config.airflowUri)"
Use the URL from the previous step to go to the Cloud Composer UI to verify a successful DAG run. If the Dag Runs column doesn't display any information, wait a few minutes and reload the page.

To verify that the data-processing workflow DAG test_word_count is deployed and is in running mode, hold the pointer over the light-green circle below DAG Runs and verify that it says Running.

DAG processing status of running.

To see the running data-processing workflow as a graph, click the light-green circle, and then on the Dag Runs page, click Dag Id: test_word_count.

Reload the Graph View page to update the state of the current DAG run. It usually takes between three to five minutes for the workflow to finish. To verify that the DAG run finishes successfully, hold the pointer over each task to verify that the tooltip says State: success. The last task, named do_comparison, is the integration test that verifies the process output against the reference file.

Create the production pipeline
When the test processing workflow runs successfully, you can promote the current version of the workflow to production. There are several ways to deploy the workflow to production:

Manually.
Automatically triggered when all the tests pass in the test or staging environments.
Automatically triggered by a scheduled job.
The automatic approaches are beyond the scope of this tutorial. For more information, see Release Engineering.

In this tutorial, you do a manual deployment to production by running the Cloud Build production deployment build. The production deployment build follows these steps:

Copy the WordCount JAR file from the test bucket to the production bucket.
Set the Cloud Composer variables for the production workflow to point to the newly promoted JAR file.
Deploy the production workflow DAG definition on the Cloud Composer environment and running the workflow.
Variable substitutions define the name of the latest JAR file that is deployed to production with the Cloud Storage buckets used by the production processing workflow. To create the Cloud Build pipeline that deploys the production airflow workflow, complete the following steps:

In Cloud Shell, read the filename of the latest JAR file by printing the Cloud Composer variable for the JAR filename:


export DATAFLOW_JAR_FILE_LATEST=$(gcloud composer environments run $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION variables -- \
    --get dataflow_jar_file_test 2>&1 | grep -i '.jar')
Use the build pipeline configuration file, deploy_prod.yaml, to create the pipeline in Cloud Build:


cd ~/ci-cd-for-data-processing-workflow/source-code/build-pipeline
gcloud builds submit --config=deploy_prod.yaml --substitutions=\
REPO_NAME=$SOURCE_CODE_REPO,\
_DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_TEST=$DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_TEST,\
_DATAFLOW_JAR_FILE_LATEST=$DATAFLOW_JAR_FILE_LATEST,\
_DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_PROD=$DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_PROD,\
_COMPOSER_INPUT_BUCKET=$INPUT_BUCKET_PROD,\
_COMPOSER_ENV_NAME=$COMPOSER_ENV_NAME,\
_COMPOSER_REGION=$COMPOSER_REGION,\
_COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET=$COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET,\
_COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_PROD=$COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_PROD
Verify the data-processing workflow created by the production pipeline
Get the URL for your Cloud Composer UI:


gcloud composer environments describe $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION \
    --format="get(config.airflowUri)"
To verify that the production data-processing workflow DAG is deployed, go to the URL that you retrieved in the previous step and verify that prod_word_count DAG is in the list of DAGs.

On the DAGs page, in the prod_word_count row, click Trigger Dag.

Play icon to trigger DAG.

In the Confirmation dialog, click Confirm.

Reload the page to update the DAG run status. To verify that the production data-processing workflow DAG is deployed and is in running mode, hold the pointer over the light-green circle below DAG Runs and verify that it says Running.

DAG runs status of running.

After the run succeeds, hold the pointer over the dark-green circle below the DAG runs column and verify that it says Success.

DAG run status of success.

In Cloud Shell, list the result files in the Cloud Storage bucket:


gsutil ls gs://$RESULT_BUCKET_PROD
The output is similar to the following:


gs://â€¦-composer-result-prod/output-00000-of-00003
gs://â€¦-composer-result-prod/output-00001-of-00003
gs://â€¦-composer-result-prod/output-00002-of-00003
Note: Typically, the production data workflow job execution is either triggered by events, such as files being stored in buckets, or is scheduled to run on a regular basis. It's important that the deployment job ensures that production data workflow isn't currently running before you deploy. In a production environment, you can use dag_state of the Airflow CLI commands to retrieve the status of a DAG run.
Configuring a build trigger
You set up a Cloud Build trigger that triggers a new build when changes are pushed to the master branch of the source repository.

In Cloud Shell, run the following command to get all the substitution variables needed for the build. Make a note of these values because they are needed in a later step.


echo "_DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET : ${DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET_TEST}
_COMPOSER_INPUT_BUCKET : ${INPUT_BUCKET_TEST}
_COMPOSER_REF_BUCKET : ${REF_BUCKET_TEST}
_COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET : ${COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET}
_COMPOSER_ENV_NAME : ${COMPOSER_ENV_NAME}
_COMPOSER_REGION : ${COMPOSER_REGION}
_COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_TEST : ${COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_TEST}"
In the Cloud Console, go to the Build triggers page.

Go to Build Triggers page

Click Create trigger.

Click Cloud Source Repository, and then click Continue.

Click data-pipeline-source, and then click Continue.

To configure trigger settings, complete the following steps:

In the Name field, enter Trigger build in test environment.
For Trigger type, click Branch.
In the Branch (regex) field, enter master.
For Configuration, click Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json).
In the Cloud Build configuration file location field, enter build-pipeline/build_deploy_test.yaml.
On the Trigger settings page, replace the variables with values from your environment that you got from the earlier step. Add the following one at a time and click + Add item for each of the name-value pairs.

_DATAFLOW_JAR_BUCKET
_COMPOSER_INPUT_BUCKET
_COMPOSER_REF_BUCKET
_COMPOSER_DAG_BUCKET
_COMPOSER_ENV_NAME
_COMPOSER_REGION
_COMPOSER_DAG_NAME_TEST

Mapping of name-value pairs.

Click Create trigger.

Test the trigger
To test the trigger, you add a new word to the test input file and make the corresponding adjustment to the test reference file. You verify that the build pipeline is triggered by a commit push to Cloud Source Repositories and that the data-processing workflow runs correctly with the updated test files.

In Cloud Shell, add a test word at the end of the test file:


echo "testword" >>  ~/$SOURCE_CODE_REPO/workflow-dag/support-files/input.txt
Update the test result reference file, ref.txt, to match the changes done in the test input file:


echo "testword: 1" >>  ~/$SOURCE_CODE_REPO/workflow-dag/support-files/ref.txt
Commit and push changes to Cloud Source Repositories:


cd ~/$SOURCE_CODE_REPO
git add .
git commit -m 'change in test files'
git push google master
In the Cloud Console, go to the History page.

GO TO HISTORY PAGE

To verify that a new build is triggered by the previous push to master branch, on the current running build, the Trigger column says Push to master branch.

In Cloud Shell, get the URL for your Cloud Composer web interface:


gcloud composer environments describe $COMPOSER_ENV_NAME \
    --location $COMPOSER_REGION --format="get(config.airflowUri)"
After the build finishes, go to the URL from the previous command to verify that the test_word_count DAG is running.

Wait until the DAG run finishes, which is indicated when the light green circle in the DAG runs column goes away. It usually takes between three to five minutes for the process to finish.

In Cloud Shell, download the test result files:


mkdir ~/result-download
cd ~/result-download
gsutil cp gs://$RESULT_BUCKET_TEST/output* .
Verify that the newly added word is in one of the result files:


grep testword output*
The output is similar to the following:


output-00000-of-00003:testword: 1
Cleaning up
To avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this tutorial, either delete the project that contains the resources, or keep the project and delete the individual resources.

Delete the project
Caution: Deleting a project has the following effects:
Everything in the project is deleted. If you used an existing project for this tutorial, when you delete it, you also delete any other work you've done in the project.
Custom project IDs are lost. When you created this project, you might have created a custom project ID that you want to use in the future. To preserve the URLs that use the project ID, such as an appspot.com URL, delete selected resources inside the project instead of deleting the whole project.
In the Cloud Console, go to the Manage resources page.
Go to Manage resources

In the project list, select the project that you want to delete, and then click Delete.
In the dialog, type the project ID, and then click Shut down to delete the project.
